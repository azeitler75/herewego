         <h2>How I upgraded</h2>
           <p>WOW! 6 exciting weeks have passed by and it is hard to believe that I just deployed my 1st website.  First, thanks for this rare opportunity to participate in the Learn to Code program.  I was amazed that I made a website in such a short amount of time, think of what I could do if I had more time.</p>    
           <figure id="Home-image">
           <img src="Thetruck.JPG" width="400" height="200" alt="Red White and Blue 6100 truck">
            <figcaption><Small><i>The 6100 Truck</i><Small></Small></figcaption>

            <p>I asked my good friend Melissa to look at my website for spelling and grammar errors.  She is very good at what she does and I appreciated it.  We then sat down with a printed copy of my website and edited everything.  Melissa and I both agreed that the site was pretty plain and needed some color.  I started to revise by typing all the styles individually on each page.  Then I paused what am I doing, I need to create a style.css doc.  On my revision I added one, I had no idea how easy life can be when you use a style doc.  I played around with all sorts of colors, this helped me see what I was changing on the website.  It went so quickly; I did some editing, scaled back on the colors, and voila I created my final draft.</p>
