            <h2>About Aimee Jo</h2>
            <p>I have a long history of working in the Ford family. Even prior to my 22 years at Ford Motor Credit, I worked at TRW Vehicle Safety Systems. In the late 90s I assembled igniters for the driver-side airbag on the state of the art at the time, Ford Automated assembly line. I joined the Ford Motor Credit team in January of 2000. Over the past two decades I have worked in several positions; Administrative Assistant, Collections, and Customer Service Representative. While working for Ford Motor Credit I also earned my Associates degree in Accounting and Bachelors degree in Business Administration. I furthered my education and earned a Black Belt certificate in 6 Sigma.</p>

             <p>I am excited to take my career to the next level and add Software Engineer to my list of accomplishments. Some of my strengths that will guide me in this position are working collaboratively or individually, continuing my education, and keeping up with the latest trends. After finishing the Learn to Code training course I was surprised how exciting writing code can be, it was enjoyable and creative.  Thank you for this opportunity.</p>
