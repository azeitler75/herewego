                <h1>Photography,Videogrophy, and Editing</h1>
                <p style="text-align:center">My passion for photography started in High School when I was a member of the Year Book club. Over the years I have enjoyed capturing events and places with my Canon EOS Rebel T3I. With the rapid technology in smartphones, lately, I have found myself putting down my camera and just using my smartphone to capture special moments.</p>  
                <p style="text-align:center">One of our family hobbies is off-road racing. My husband's best friend Craig Dillard is the owner, mechanic, and driver of a 6100 Baja truck, and my husband Rick Nealy is his co-drive. Our group tries to attend two or more races a year. One in Laughlin, NV, and the other in Rocky Point, Mexico. We currently run a 6.2 LS 450 horsepower engine with a Turbo 400 automatic transmission. In 2019 they changed the 6100 class rules by increasing the horsepower to 525. We are now on the hunt for sponsors so we can upgrade our engine to stay competitive in our division. This was the perfect opportunity for me to get creative and show you how I did it.</p>

           <h1>How to create a YouTube video</h1>
            <h3>Step 1 Gathering Material</h3>
                <p>For me gathering photos and videos is not a problem, I enjoy capturing special moments.  If you are having issues; pick an event that you enjoy, grab your smartphone, and set out on an adventure.</p>

                </figure>
            <h3>Step 2  Upload Material</h3>
                <p>Depending on how large your files are, you might want to use Dropbox to transfer your files from your phone to your desktop.  From your smartphone log into Dropbox and upload your material.  If you do not have Dropbox <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/home">Click Here!</a></p>

                </figure>    
            <h3>Step 3  Download Material</h3>
                <p>I prefer to use my desktop when editing.  On your desktop navigate to the web and log in to Dropbox.  Pull all the material you want to use from Dropbox and add it to a folder on your desktop.</p>

                </figure>
            <h3>Step 4  Edit Photos</h3>
                <p>I am comfortable with Photo Gallery for editing that came installed on my desktop.  My two favorite buttons to use are Auto Adjust and Crop.  There are several other options to use in this program so take the time to explore and have fun.  Next, make sure all the edited photos have been saved to your desktop.</p>

                </figure>
            <h3>Step 5  Choose a Software</h3>
                <p>There are so many choices of video-making software on the market, I selected Canva.  I have a friend that creates videos and they like this program.  I was impressed with the software and its abilities, to download canva <a href="https://www.canva.com">Click Here!</a>.  There is also an app that I downloaded on my smartphone.</p>

                </figure>
            <h3>Step 6  Start a Project</h3>
                <p>Once your account is created you can now start a new project, I want to create a video so I selected video.  I uploaded all my edited pictures from my desktop and then my unedited video.  I was able to select a theme, background, and music from their approved selection.  I do pay $12.99 a month for this service, this helps me to avoid any copyright issues.</p>

                </figure>
            <h3>Step 7  Edit Video</h3>
                 <p>Canva makes editing easy, once I got the hang of how the program runs it was a breeze to edit.  The purple area is the start and end of the saved video, the washed-out area on the outer sides will be deleted.  You can move the bar around with your mouse to select the area you wish to choose.  I had about 8 minutes of video that went down to less than 6 minutes.</p>

            <h3>Step 8  Save and Create File</h3>
                 <p>Once you are satisfied with your video it's time to download as an MP4 video.  On the upper right side select download, then make sure you have the MP4 video selected and all the slides.  Save the file on your desktop.</p>
